# TODO List for Adding begining_date and ending_date to /api/trainingssession/student/{id} Response

## Task: Add begining_date and ending_date fields to the response of the student training session endpoint

### Steps:

- [x] Step 1: Update the `findOneForStudent` method in `src/trainingssession/trainingssession.service.ts` to include 'begining_date' and 'ending_date' in the attributes array.
- [x] Step 2: Update the Swagger @ApiResponse schema in `src/trainingssession/trainingssession.controller.ts` for the `findOneForStudent` endpoint to include the new date fields in the data properties.
- [x] Step 3: Verify the changes by reviewing the updated files and ensuring no breaking changes.

### Notes:

- Ensure date fields are formatted as 'date-time' in Swagger.
- No database migrations needed as fields already exist in the model.
- Test the endpoint after changes to confirm the response includes the new fields.
